# UCL Computer Science Exercises and more
Includes: Programming exercises, UML &amp; System Design exercises and other relevant stuff in terms of Computer Science (Datamatiker) @ UCL.

I've added them to GitHub so I have acces to them in case some weird stuff happens. 
I will also be going by them one by one and do them again (I've forgot some stuff sadly)


don't enjoy (ğŸ¤¡) and I hope i dont get copyright strikes from the school ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€
